		<?= _('WtDesk  is an user friendly, easy to use HelpDesk solution that offers direct online submission of require support within your database and real-time monitoring is make available to mobile devices and Web. <br>Based on our experience of implementing large scale projects, an effective and efficient Helpdesk contributes significantly to the success of an IT project, more so for one that is implemented on a national or international basis. This is because a very important stakeholder of the project, i.e. the Users, are ensured that they have access to professional support services besides just making a quick telephone call or sending email to a known and helpful destination.<br>A problem ticket will be raised for each problem reported to WtDesk Helpdesk, and the problem ticket is then tracked until the problem is fully resolved. In the event that WtDesk Helpdesk personnel taking the call cannot resolve the problem, the problem will be escalated to the second level Project Helpdesk for resolution, followed by the third level Support Team if necessary, until the issues solved.') ?>
